    Also, I think article content should be more "focus"ed. Still, the pattern should be "Z" pattern. -->

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>The classes I am currently taking this term are Workshop Leadership for Computer Science, Machines and Consciousness, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Organization and Advanced Front End Web Development. Aside from these course, I am also currently participating in this year’s production of the Vagina Monologues, auditioning for No Jacket’s Required show, called the Vinyl Show. I am also currently participating in the art exhibit for The Underhill, a exhibit that will take place in February to display for the public in both Drama House and Hartnett.</p>
        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
         </div>
     <div class="about">
        <p>I currently work as the Hartnett Gallery’s media manager, as well as previously as the media manager for the Art Awake event that occurred on campus. I have worked as a media manager for both for the equivalent about two years. I have worked on graphics for the Art Awake event, as well as worked on a variety of graphics for several people who have asked in the past. I currently work as the art director for the Underhill exhibit, in which I contact all the artists to create a collaborative piece in the next ten days. I have also networked with both the Underhill Team and the Hartnett Team to create media for the exhibit itself to make it displayable, as well as to make the event far more polished. I’ve been working as the person to go to about any questions about artwork, as well as focusing on contacting people about their individual pieces of art, as well as creating my own. I’ll be doing a collaboration with Margo Slate that focuses on intertwining living and dying creatures, as well as my own individual piece that features a woman who wears a crown of flowers, who is surrounded by dying imagery.</p>

        <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
        <p>My current music tastes must revolve around a few artists. I’m a really big fan of Sufjan Stevens who recently came out with a fantastic album called “Carrie and Lowell”. It features memories from his past life with his parents, as well as his tragic past. It is one of the best albums I’ve heard in a long time and lead to my girlfriend purchasing the album on vinyl for me. I’ve collected several vinyl’s over the last few months including ones such as Beyoncé’s Lemonade (that includes a beautiful visual album discussing her affair with Jay-Z), St. Vincent’s Mass education, as well as Glass Animal’s How to be a Human. I personally have slowly fallen in love with far more artists than I have in the past due to my lack of motivation to continue with computer science and art recently so I have been exploring far more music to get me in the right headset to keep going.</p>
