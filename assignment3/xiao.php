        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>The reasons why I changed my major were complicated, but mostly because AME was not something I thought it would be. After taking several CS classes, I realized that I am really interested in UI/UX design, 3D modeling, game design, and front-end stuffs. I enjoy seeing the beautiful results that my work turned out to be. I guess I am more of a visual person anyways. Minoring in Philosophy is something that I never thought I would be doing. Taking my first Philosophy class was a complete coincidence - I was just trying to fulfill my minimum credits requirement after dropping one of the classes I took in my freshman year. I feel so happy about this coincidence because I met one of my favorite professors in this university. He made Philosophy so interesting. I always question myself about whether I would choose this path if my first Philosophy professor was not him. I doubt that I would. Philosophy has helped me develop my critical thinking skill and logical processing skill. I feel very proud of my minor because it makes me who I am.</p>
     <h2>Work Experience</h2>

      <div class="about">
        <p>I have not had any internships yet. Being a workshop leader last semester was technically my first job. As an international student, I always felt nervous when talking to a group of people in English. Before my first workshop last semester, I stayed up late the entire night worrying that I might not do well for that position. Despite that, I stepped out of my comfort zone. At the end of that semester, I got used to getting up early every Thursday and stepping into that room confidently. It became my routine. Thanks to that experience, I had grown more confident and I believed in myself more. Making up my mind applying for this position is the one of the best decisions I have ever made.</p>

        <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
        <p>If you ask me to make a list about things I cannot live without, the top three have to be family, friends, and music. I dig all genres of music except for heavy metal (because it is a bit loud for me). I take my headphones with me all the time. I also love singing - rap, pop, or any songs that I find challenging. I also love Broadway shows. My favorite is Wicked. I find it amazing how the actors/actresses can express the emotions that thoroughly through music.</p>
