## CSC 174 Assignment 2 - Team Portfolio

Masaru Fujimaki - IA  
Xuanyang Wang - Design Artist  
Bei Lu - Coder  

IA: Masaru Fuijimaki

Design Artist: Xuanyang Wang (Valerie)
Basically, I implemented CSS for the main content and navigation bar after the IA and Coder have constructed the structure for the portfolio website. I made some adjustments to the content to make the website look more consistent. Also, I added photos of our team members to each page and implemented a new JS slideshow plugin on the home page. I changed the CSS and bootstrap that the Coder had included in the repository before to satisfy the basic design principles as required.

Coder: Bei Lu (Cherry)
I implemented the JS plugin after the IA construct the basic content, then I sorted files in the repository in different categories. At this tage, I also implemented a minimum amount of css just to see if the JS plugin is working, but details are open to changs by the designer. I also set up includes files for links and script that are repetitive in all pages, including navigation, head link, scripts and footers. Then I implemented bootstrap for our website and applied it to the website, but the designers were not familiar with bootstrap so the only part that keept using bootstrap was the footer. In terms of index page JS, originally I implemented 3 collapse buttons for each pages where a breif piece of information can be displayed or disapeard when clicked. Then our team decided to implement the good old slideshow, so our designer designed it. At the end, I upload the website to the class server and validated it for both CSS and HTML.
